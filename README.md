Chicago Crime Data Analysis

Dataset: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2 provides reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago.  These data are available from 2001 through the present. For this project, I have filtered down the data for 2018 only.
